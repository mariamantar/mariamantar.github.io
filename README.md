# mariamantar.github.io

| This website was created by Mariam Antar for the Gentech portfolio project

I created my portfolio using html/css/Jquery and javascript. I used bootstrap for the navigation bar on every single page. I decided to make single pages because I find it sorts out the content better and provides a clean look to the website compared to if it was only one page.

##Frameworks used
https://codepen.io/stephanrusu/pen/QwKLJX
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/
https://fontawesome.com/
https://fonts.google.com/

##Design decisions
For the design I kept going back and forth between something minimal and something very interactive and animated. In the end i settled for a simple sleek design. There was a lot that I wanted to alter from the content to the contact page. I had created multiple wireframes for what I wanted and settled for the design shown below. https://mariamantar.github.io/index.html


 I created four separate pages including a home page, about page, projects page and contact page with a contact form. I used the book called the art of skiing for design inspiration

##Difficulties
I experienced a lot of difficulties trying to get the navigation bar to look the same on every page , centering content, getting the site to be responsive on all devices ,getting the footer to stick to the bottom on the about page, contact form to process emails with php and adding blogposts from another website (medium) to the bottom of the home page.

##Changes I would make

-Prioritise tasks better
-Manage time better
-Fix header and add hover color
-about page footer
-Make the website responsive
